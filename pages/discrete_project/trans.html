        <h2>Transportation Systems</h2>
        <p>Clean energy plays a critical role in combating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the primary drivers of global warming. Unlike fossil fuels, clean energy sources such as solar, wind, hydropower, and geothermal produce electricity without releasing carbon dioxide or other harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. By transitioning to these sustainable energy solutions, we can significantly decrease the accumulation of greenhouse gases, slow the pace of global temperature rise, and mitigate extreme weather events. Additionally, clean energy technologies often improve energy efficiency and reduce reliance on finite resources, fostering a more resilient and sustainable future. Embracing clean energy is not only essential for addressing climate change but also for protecting ecosystems, human health, and global economies from its adverse effects.</p>
