        <h2>Food Systems</h2>
        <p>Food systems play a significant role in driving climate change, contributing to around one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions. Agriculture, particularly livestock production, is a major source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, while deforestation for croplands and pastures releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide. Additionally, energy-intensive processes like food processing, packaging, transportation, and storage contribute to emissions. Overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides further exacerbates environmental degradation, releasing nitrous oxide and contaminating ecosystems. On the consumption side, food waste compounds the problem, as decomposing organic matter in landfills generates methane. Transitioning to sustainable practices—such as reducing food waste, adopting plant-based diets, and promoting regenerative agriculture—can significantly reduce the food system's impact on the climate.</p>
