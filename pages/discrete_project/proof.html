        <h2>Proof Climate Change is Real</h2>
        
        <p>Prove: If global temperatures are rising then climate change is real. </p>
        <p><strong>T</strong>=temperatures are rising</p>
        <p><strong>C</strong>=Climate change is real</p>
        <p>Prove: <strong>T</strong> &#8594; <strong>C</strong></p>
        <h3>Proof by Contradiction</h3>
        <p>Contradictive Statement: <strong>T</strong> &#8594; <strong>~C</strong></p>
        <p>First we prove that temperatures are rising.</p> 
        <img src="GlobalTemp.png" width="50%">
        <p>This graph proves that the average global temperature is rising.</p>
        <p><strong>T</strong> being true means that according to our contradictory statement, climate change is not real. </p>
        <p>However, as defined by NASA, climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth's local, regional and global climates. Climate refers to the long-term (usually at least 30 years) regional or even global average of temperature, humidity, and rainfall patterns over seasons, years, or decades.</p>
        <p>This directly contradicts our assertion that climate change is real therefore proving that climate change is real.</p>
