        <h2>Consumerism</h2>
        <p>Consumerism significantly impacts climate change by driving the demand for goods and services that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. The production, transportation, and disposal of consumer goods often involve energy-intensive processes reliant on fossil fuels, leading to higher carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Additionally, the emphasis on fast fashion, electronics, and single-use products exacerbates waste generation, with many items ending up in landfills, releasing harmful gases as they decompose. The extraction of raw materials for these goods also depletes natural resources, damages ecosystems, and increases deforestation, further reducing the Earth's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide. Ultimately, consumerism fosters a culture of overconsumption that strains the planet's resources, amplifying the environmental challenges associated with climate change.</p>
